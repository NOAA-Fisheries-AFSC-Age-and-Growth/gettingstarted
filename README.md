### Why using A&G GitHub repositories will be fun:

Our hope is that this will be helpful in the following ways:

1) It can be a space to create new repositories to house code for individual projects to help with personal version control and organization. 

2) It can be a space to view other ongoing research projects within the group.

3) It can be a space to see and download code used for similar applications in the past to adapt to our own work. This can help us with efficiency as well as constant improvement.(We should still always give credit when building off the work of others!)

4) It can be a space to collaborate on analysis and coding products together.

#### There are a few different ways to interact with shared A&G GitHub repositories.

<br>

#### Level one: 
View a GitHub repository like a website and download code. You don't even need to have a GitHub account. You can visit current repositories here:

- For code relating to Raman spectroscopy: <https://github.com/NOAA-Fisheries-AFSC-Age-and-Growth/raman-spectroscopy>

- For code relating to NIR spectroscopy:
<https://github.com/NOAA-Fisheries-AFSC-Age-and-Growth/nir-spectroscopy>

<br>

#### Level two: 
Connect your RStudio to GitHub and pull code directly in from repositories, create files, pull edits to keep up to date on current versions.

This requires a bit more set up. A good resource can be found here:
<https://happygitwithr.com/>

<br>

#### Level three:
Collaborate! Prerequisites will be having a GitHub account set up with your NOAA email address and requesting to join the Age and Growth GitHub organization. This will allow you to pull code as well as push edits and collaborate on products.

<br>

Hopefully, this can be a fun way to learn a new skill together.
